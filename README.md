# Machine Learning Study Notes
In this section, I will include personal study notes/materials for Udacity's basic machine learning nanodegree program.  This course provides fundamental knowledge on machine learning which includes: *supervised learning*, *deep learning*, and *unsupervised learning*.

## Notes
- [Supervised learning](https://github.com/sclkan/ML-Study-Notes/blob/master/supervised_learning_notes.ipynb)
- [Unsupervised learning](https://github.com/sclkan/ML-Study-Notes/blob/master/unsupervised_learning_notes.ipynb)

## Exercise
- Create a spam classifier by using Naive Bayes algorithms with bagging, random forests and boosting: [codes](https://github.com/sclkan/ML-Study-Notes/blob/master/Spam_Classifier_Naive_Bayes.ipynb)
- Evaluate regression models: [codes](https://github.com/sclkan/ML-Study-Notes/blob/master/Boston_Housing_Regression.ipynb)
- Use grid search to optimize model parameters: [codes](https://github.com/sclkan/ML-Study-Notes/blob/master/Diabetes_Case_Study.ipynb)
- PCA workbooks: [1](https://github.com/sclkan/ML-Study-Notes/blob/master/PCA_1.ipynb)
